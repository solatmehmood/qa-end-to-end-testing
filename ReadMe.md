# QA Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Quality Assurance Projects Portfolio**! This repository demonstrates my hands-on experience in multiple QA domains including **Automation, API Testing, Performance Testing (JMeter), and Database Testing**. Each project showcases real-world scenarios, test design, reporting, and analytical skills, highlighting my capability to ensure software quality.

## Skills Demonstrated

### Automation Testing
- End-to-End web automation using **Python, Selenium, Pytest**
- Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable test design
- HTML reports, screenshots, and logging for detailed analysis

### API Testing
- REST API validation using **Python Requests, Postman, and Pytest**
- Positive and negative test scenarios, authentication, and response verification

### Performance Testing (JMeter)
- Load and stress testing for web applications and APIs
- Simulate multiple concurrent users, measure response times, throughput, and errors
- Generate detailed HTML reports and graphs to analyze performance

### Database Testing
- SQL queries and Python scripts for **data validation, CRUD testing, and integrity checks**
- Testing real-world database scenarios ensuring consistency and correctness

## How to Use

- **For JMeter projects:**
  - Open the `.jmx` test plan in **JMeter GUI**
  - Run the test plan and generate HTML reports in the `reports/` folder

> Each project folder contains its own README with project-specific setup, execution instructions, and results.
